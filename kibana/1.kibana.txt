so we have to install kibana 

sudo apt-get install kibana
sudo vi /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
    change server.host to 0.0.0.0

sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload 
sudo /bin/systemctl enable kibana.service 
sudo /bin/systemctl start kibana.service


kibana works on port 5601 

NOTE: WHEN INSTALLING KIBANA AND elasticsearch PLEASE ENSURE THEIR VERSIONS ARE THE SAME 

TO CHECK THE VERSION OF elasticsearch RUN CURL -XGET IPADDRESS:PORTNUMBER 
                        KIBANA RUN  sudo apt list kibana 

    after intalling kibana then run 

    sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml and then change the server.host to 0.0.0.0 



                                             PLAYING WITH KIBANA 

TO see data ,  we should go to stack management and click on data views and create a data view 


DISCOVER MODE 
AND YOU CAN CREATE VISUALIZATION 


you can use lens to create graohds and histigrams  


you can also use developer tools  




                                            EXPLORING DATA WITH KIBANA 
when yiu enter kibana dashboard click on visualization to create a new visualization from the data loaded 


                                                   KIBANA LENS
    nproc = helps to show system cores 
    free -h = for memory space 

You can use metric beats to collect system informationon a linux systm by installing it and then using kibana lens to visualize it  

you can data view to seperate the logged files into various parts and then you can visualization to choose the part of the date you wanna see from the data views 
amd you can use drag and drop on the visualization data board and after visualizing you can save  



                                                       KIBANA MANAGMENT 
apart from kibana visual data it can still manage elastic search by using the following 

1. spaces= organize dahsboard , visualization and saved objects and mangaging users and access to multiple spaces fpr isers 
2. migrating visualization 
3. advanced settings such as dark mode and light mode 


we go to stack management and go to kibana session and underspaces we can filter who can see the data under feature visibility 

spaces means to allow a certain groips see what other people cannot see 
you can choose the url in adc=vance settings when user login into their kibana dashboard
