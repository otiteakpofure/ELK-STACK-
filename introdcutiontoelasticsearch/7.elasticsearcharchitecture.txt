elastic search is made up of computer of shards and these shards are clusters 
these clusters,  and they can scaled uo easily and these shards are just lucene 
ELastsic SEARCH works like kubernetes 
NOTE: THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY SHARDS CANNOT BE CHANGED 

SO YOU HAVE TO STATE IT IN THE PUT REQUEST THE NUMBER OF SHARDS YOU WANT 

SO IJ ELASTI SEARCH , YOU CAN USE THE NUMBER OF SHARDS TO REPRESENT YOUR PRIMARY SHARD 
and the replicas to represent your copies of those shards 

so if you state a put request and you state number of shards to be 3 and replicas is 1 
 

 it will be 3 primary shards and 1 replicases of each shards
 there making everything 6
