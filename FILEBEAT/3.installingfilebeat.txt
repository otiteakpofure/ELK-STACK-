sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install filebeat 

after you install filebeat you go to cd /etc/filebeat/module.d 

and then enable the file you want 

when you open the above file path  you can then run the following 

for exampple if you want to check apache logs and most of the files are disabled 

so for example, apache.yml.disabled , you will have to run mv apache.yml.disabled to apache.yml so the logs can be sent 
and then open the file apache.enable and enable the access: 
                                                     enabled: from false to true 

                                                     as well as the error: 
                                                                     enabled: true 
and then change the path to the error logs and var.path to the path which will be sent to filebeat 

so for example,  var.paths: ["/home/student/logs/access*"]
