FILEBEAT BACKPRESSURE 

It is the reason for allowing logstash and filebeat work together because logstash would not be able to process all the data at each given time 


logstash uses persistent queues and ensure no less than two logstash nodes run in your production environment 

persistent queues can also be stored on a disk as well 

in elastic search you need atleast 3 master nodes and nodes to store hot and warm data 

encryptuion should alo be enabled
