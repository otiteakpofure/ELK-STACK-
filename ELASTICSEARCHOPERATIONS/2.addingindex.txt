 how can i add an index 

 you can create a new index by dong the following 

 PUT /new_index
 {
    "settings": {
        "number_of_shards": place the nyumber here,
        "number_of_replicas": place the number of replicas here 
    }
 }

 or you can use index templates 

 you can do this on your kibana dashboards and before you do this check if there is an existing shards 

 by running this command on the kibana console 

 GET thenameoftheindes/_settings 
 lets say the index is man 

 GET man/_settings 



 so to put a new index in kibana dashboards

 for example the new index is testindex , you can run the command on the kibana dahsboard 

 
 PUT /testindex 
 {
    "settings": {
        "number_of_shards": 4,
        "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
 }
