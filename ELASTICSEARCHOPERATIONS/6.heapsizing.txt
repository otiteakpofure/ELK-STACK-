the default heap size is 1GB FOR ELASTICSEARCH 

THE HEAP SIZE should not interfere with the size set for elastic search so that issues will not happen 

to set the heap in elastic search , you can do the following 

export ES_HEAP_SIZE = 10g 

or ES_JAVA_OPTS = "-xms10g -xms10g" ./bin/elasticsearch 


NOTE: DO not cross 32gb
