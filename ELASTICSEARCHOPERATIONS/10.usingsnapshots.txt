to perform snapshots watch ths snapshots video on how you can do various types of snapshot on elasticsearch 

to do this elastic search do the following 

open the elasticsearch.yml file 

and then create a path.repo variable and for example you want to store it in the home folder you can do thenfollowing 

path.repo= ["home/students/backups"] = this shows the location in which the backup will be stored 

 alternatively you can do this on the kibana dashboard using 

 PUT _snapshot/givethenameofthebackuphere 
 {
    "type":"fs"'
    "settings":{
        "location":"loatioofthewhereyouwanttostorethebackups/nameofthebackup
    }
 }

 so afte that kick off the snapshot 

 PUT _snapshot/givethenameofthebackuphere/CREATETHESNAPSHOTNAMEHERE to officially kickstart the kick off procss in kibana
