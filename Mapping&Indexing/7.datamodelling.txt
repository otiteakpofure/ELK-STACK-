                  DATA MODELLING AND PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP

TO ALLOWS aprent and child relationship under the mappings , you use the type = join to do so . 

and you can also write in the jsob file by writing parent = 1 or any number you choose 




                                    FLATTENED DATATYPE 


MAPPING EXPLOSIONS IS WHEN THERE ARE TOO MAY FILEDS IN A JSON DOCUMENT 

TO PREvent mapping explosions we use the flattened datatype 

                   CLUSTER STATE 
You can also get the cluster state of shards 


                                       ELASTICSEARCH CLUSTER

                                            CREATING AN INDEX 
In creating an index , you can do the following 


curl -xput "theipaddress/thenameoftheindex"


to do a flattend type you can do the following 


curl -XPUT "theipaddress/thenameoftheindex/_mapping" -d {

    "properties":{
        "host":{
            "type":"flattened"
        }
    }
}



    NOTE: FLATTENED TYPE DOES NOT HAVE PARTIAL MATCHING IT MUST BE EXACT
